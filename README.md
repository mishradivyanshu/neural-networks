Coursera deeplearning.ai - Deep Learning Specialization - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This document contains a guide to help you to start experimenting with Coursera deeplearning.ai specialization assignments as easily as possible through a Jupyter notebook running on FloydHub.

The code in this project was ported from the official course, but only the necessary files to run this specific project were selected. The data used in this project is already available as a FloydHub dataset.

You can find the video lectures about Neural Network and Deep Learning specialization on Deeplearning.ai's official youtube channel.

Assignment 1: Python Basics with Numpy
Welcome to your first programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this assignment you will:

Learn how to use numpy.

Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, tanh, etc...

Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.

Recognize the importance of vectorization.

Understand how python broadcasting works.

Run on FloydHub
